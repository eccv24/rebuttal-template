\section{Introduction}

After receiving paper reviews, the authors may optionally submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers' comments, which will be limited to a {\bf one page} PDF file.
Please follow the steps and style guidelines outlined below for submitting your author response.

The author rebuttal is optional and, following similar guidelines to previous conferences, is meant to provide you with an opportunity to rebut factual errors or to supply additional information requested by the reviewers.
It is NOT intended to add new contributions (theorems, algorithms, experiments) that were absent in the original submission and NOT specifically requested by the reviewers.
You may optionally add a figure, graph, table, or proof to your rebuttal to better illustrate your answer to the reviewers' comments.

Consistent with established practices in computer vision, reviewers should refrain from requesting significant additional experiments for the rebuttal or penalize for lack of additional experiments.
Authors should refrain from including new experimental results in the rebuttal, especially when not specifically requested to do so by the reviewers.
Authors may include figures with illustrations or comparison tables of results reported in the submission/supplemental material or in other papers.

Just like the original submission, the rebuttal must maintain anonymity and cannot include external links that reveal the author identity or circumvent the length restriction.
The rebuttal must comply with this template (the use of sections is not required, though recommended to structure the rebuttal for ease of reading).
The rebuttal must also include line numbers as in this example document.
This allows for easy referencing of your response by reviewers and area chairs.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Response length}
Author responses must be no longer than 1 page in length including any references and figures.
Overlength responses will simply not be reviewed.
This includes responses where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those laid down by this style guide.
Note that this \LaTeX\ guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Formatting your Response}

{\bf Make sure to update the paper title and paper ID in the appropriate place in the \verb+tex+ file.}

All text must be in a two-column format.
The total allowable size of the text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.46 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54 cm) high.
Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a $\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them.
The top margin should begin 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the page.
The bottom margin should be $1\frac{1}{8}$ inches (2.86 cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper;
for A4 paper, approximately $1\frac{5}{8}$ inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the page.

Please number any displayed equations.
It is important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used.
The main text should be in 10-point Times, single-spaced.
Section headings should be in 10 or 12 point Times.
All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx.\ $\frac{1}{6}$ inch or 0.422 cm).
Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in \cref{fig:onecol}.


List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times, single-spaced,
at the end of your response.
When referenced in the text, enclose the citation number in square brackets, for example~\cite{Alpher05}.
Where appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule{0pt}{0.5in} \rule{0.9\linewidth}{0pt}}
  %\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{egfigure.eps}
   \caption{Example of caption.  It is set in Roman so that mathematics
   (always set in Roman: $B \sin A = A \sin B$) may be included without an
   ugly clash.}
   \label{fig:onecol}
\end{figure}

To avoid ambiguities, it is best if the numbering for equations, figures, tables, and references in the author response does not overlap with that in the main paper (the reviewer or AC may wonder if you talk about \cref{fig:onecol} in the author response or in the actual paper).
See the \LaTeX\ source of the rebuttal template for a workaround.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

Please ensure that any point you wish to make is resolvable in a printed copy of the response.
Resize fonts in figures to at least 6\:pt ($\sim$2\:mm character height), and choose line widths that render effectively in print.
Readers (and reviewers/ACs), even of an electronic copy, may choose to print your response in order to read it.
You cannot insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.
